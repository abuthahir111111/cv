        <p>I am an undergrad chemical engineering student studying in IIT Tirupati. Since I am studying
        in an IIT, it makes me feel a bit cocky. And I like girls. Western white colored blue-eyed chicks.
        Despite what u might think, I am not a racist. It's just my taste. Besides, If I am going to choose
        a girl just based on looks, I am a complete fool. The beautiful chick that is now ur girlfriend
        will be sucking the dick of a nba player on ur back, and he might be screwing her. While normal or ugly girls
        that u chose considering the compatibility in mind, would be more loyal. It doesn't mean that beautiful
        women are bitches. Its just that they are the ones who can afford to be bitches. Not the normal or ugly looking
        ones. So, statistically, beautiful western women are more likely to be a bitch (as eastern cultures are
        thankfully conservative). And that's why love is twisted. What is love? It's easy to understand ur parent's love
        unless you're a fucking orphan) but understanding other types of love is tough. The girlfriend that u got some
        4 weeks or before, who claims to love you, doesn't show the same responsibility as your mother who would go to
        any extent to help you if u get into an accident. Whereas, If u marry the same girlfriend, either she is going
        to take care of u like ur mother, or she is going to treat you like poop. Why are things soo confusing?
        And I love programming</p>
